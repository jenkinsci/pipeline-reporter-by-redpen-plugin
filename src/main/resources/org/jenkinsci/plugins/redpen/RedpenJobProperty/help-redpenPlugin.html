        The Redpen Jenkins plugin provides an easy and secure way to send the information of failure build from Jenkins
        server to your Jira sites. The pipeline reports the failure status of the build and deployment with meaningful
        data directly into the Jira issues which helps your team to track and collaborate.

        This plugin gives visibility to your team of the CI/CD pipelines related to Jira issues. The plugin adds the
        build and deployment related data as Jira issue comments. So, it is <strong>important</strong> that the branch
        that triggers the Jenkins pipeline <strong> must have the Jira ticket number in the branch name.</strong> (e.g.
        [TEST-1234] Deploy
        v1.2 sto production)
